# Team-2

This program initially provides a link to a downloadable Excel file template where a user can alter parameters of an ecosystem model. After the user saves the Excel file, the program can then accept a user input of a path (string type) identifying the saved Excel file. The program will output a table of calculated values and user-specified graphs.
