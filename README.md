# Team-2

The user must run the program "EcosystemModelingAnalysis." This program can be run anywhere including the Terminal, and it initially provides a link to a downloadable Excel file template where a user can alter parameters of an ecosystem model. Furthermore, the user can choose any of three output graphs as visual representations of the data. After the user saves the Excel file, the program can then accept a user input of a path identifying the file; for example, one possible path is "C:\Users\<yourname>\Downloads" (without the quotes) where <yourname> indicates the name of your personal computer. The program will output a table of calculated values and user-specified graphs.

Required packages to install: numpy, xlrd, and astropy.table
